5. WHEN a file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL scan for malware and validate file integrity

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage storage quotas and monitor usage, so that I can control costs and ensure fair resource allocation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storage usage exceeds defined thresholds THEN the system SHALL send alerts to administrators
2. WHEN a user approaches their storage quota THEN the system SHALL notify them and provide options to manage files
3. WHEN files are no longer needed THEN the system SHALL implement automated cleanup policies
4. IF storage costs exceed budget limits THEN the system SHALL provide detailed usage analytics and recommendations
5. WHEN accessing storage metrics THEN the system SHALL display real-time usage statistics and trends

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want fast and reliable access to stored content, so that my learning experience is not interrupted by slow loading times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing frequently used files THEN the system SHALL serve them from CDN cache for optimal performance
2. WHEN streaming video content THEN the system SHALL support adaptive bitrate streaming based on connection quality
3. WHEN downloading large files THEN the system SHALL support resume capability and parallel downloads
4. IF content is not immediately available THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states and progress indicators
5. WHEN accessing content from different geographic locations THEN the system SHALL route requests to the nearest Azure region

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security-conscious organization, I want all file operations to be secure and compliant, so that sensitive educational data is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria
